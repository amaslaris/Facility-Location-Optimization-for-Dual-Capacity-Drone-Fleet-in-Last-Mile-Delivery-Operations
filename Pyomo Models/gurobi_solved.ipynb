    "# Combinatorial Optimization: Facility Location Optimization for Dual-Capacity Drone Fleet in Last-Mile Delivery Operations\n",
    "## Problem Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to determine the optimal locations for facilities (e.g., drone hubs, recharging stations) to serve customer demand points effectively. Additionally, this problem involves choosing the appropriate type of drone for each delivery, balancing between **small-capacity drones** (for lighter, shorter deliveries) and **large-capacity drones** (for heavier loads or longer distances).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective:\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimize the total cost, which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Facility setup and operational costs.**\n",
    "2. **Travel and operational costs** for each type of drone.\n",
    "3. **Drone selection costs** based on the load and distance requirements for each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Facility Assignment Constraint**: Each customer must be served by one facility and one type of drone.\n",
    "2. **Facility Capacity Constraint**: Each facility has a total capacity limit for the number of drones it can support, with each type of drone occupying a different amount of space.\n",
    "3. **Assignment Activation Constraint**: A customer can only be assigned to a facility that is open.\n",
    "4. **Payload Capacity Constraint**:The assigned drone type must be able to carry the package weight.\n",
    "5. **Distance/Range Constraint**: Small-capacity drones can only serve customers within range $R_{s}$, and large capacity drones within range $R_{l}$.\n",
    "6. **Distinct Facility Assignment Constraint**: Each drone must be assigned to exactly one facility.\n",
